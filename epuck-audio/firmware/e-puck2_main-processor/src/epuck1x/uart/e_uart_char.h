 * \brief Manage UART.
 *
 * This module manage all the UART ressource.
 * \n The e-puck's microcontroller has two integreted UART:
 * UART1 and UART2.
 * 
 * A little exemple to comunicate with the e-puck through the uart.
 * For this exemple you have to connect your e-puck to your PC with 
 * bluetooth (if you don't know how it works, look at the end of page 3
 * of this doc: http://moodle.epfl.ch/mod/resource/view.php?id=12851).
 * Then open the HyperTerminal with the correct port COM
 * and launch the connection. "Give a character:" should appears on the
 * HyperTerminal.
 * \code
 * #include <motor_led/e_init_port.h>
 * #include <uart/e_uart_char.h>
 * 
 * int main(void)
 * {
 * 	char car;
 * 	e_init_port();
 * 	e_init_uart1();
 * 	e_send_uart1_char("\f\a", 2);		//new page on HyperTerminal
 * 	while(1)
 * 	{
 * 		e_send_uart1_char("Give a character:\r\n", 19);
 *		// do nothing while the text is not sent and while nothing is comming from the user
 * 		while(e_uart1_sending() || !e_ischar_uart1()) {} 
 * 		e_getchar_uart1(&car);			// read the character entered...
 * 		e_send_uart1_char("You have wrote: ", 16);
 * 		e_send_uart1_char(&car, 1);		//... and resend him to uart.
 * 		e_send_uart1_char("\r\n\r\n",4);
 * 	}
 * }
 * \endcode

 * 
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * This package contains all the ressources you need to control the UART
 * (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter). The microcontroller p30f6014A
 * has two UART controller: UART1 and UART2.
 * \warning In this package, the functions are written in ASM. We have "e_init_uartX.s" file
 * for the initializing functions, "e_uartX_rx.s" file for receiving data functions
 * and "e_uartX_tx.s" file for transmitting data functions (X can be 1 or 2).
 * \n Even these files are written in ASM, you can call them by including the e_uart_char.h
 * files in your C code (look at the exemple in e_uart_char.h).
 * \section bluettothUart_sec Bluetooth
 * The e-puck has his bluetooth module connected on the uart1. Two ways are possibles when you
 * work with bluetooth:
 * - you are the master, look at this: \ref bluetooth
 * - you are the slave.
 *
 * When you are the slave, you can communicate with the master device exactely by the same way
 * as you do to communicate through the uart. The bluetooth protocole is made to look like as
 * transparent as possible. This is possible because the master initialize the communication
 * and the bluetooth module answer automatically to create the connection. After that the
 * connection was created, you can communicate with the master by using the uart protocole.
