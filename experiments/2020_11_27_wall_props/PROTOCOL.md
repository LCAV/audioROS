## Notes 

<!-- quick and dirty notes, to be written out later -->
- last csv recording: 44, all others missing (can recover with bag file though). 
- many recordings do not have propeller sounds because of battery issues.
- there was an issue with the usb-connection of the soundcard (unstable power supply), which is why the measurement mic data of this dataset is corrupted.
