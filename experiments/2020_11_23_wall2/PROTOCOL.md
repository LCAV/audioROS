# EXPERIMENT NAME

__Time__: Day DD.MM.YYYY

__Recorded by__: First Last, ...

__Place__: Place, if necessary temperature etc. 

## Notes 

<!-- quick and dirty notes, to be written out later -->
- this experiment was done with the super long motors, for which there is an error in linear motion (going and coming back leads to a few milimeters shift with respect to starting position). 
- These are new experiments with fewer thrust experiments
- 40 and 50 cm: corrupted, because stopped working at motors_360_40 (motors stopped and from then on no more buzzer deck)
- started again at 60 cm
- did wrong measurements at 60 (angle offset), so had to start again

- next day: first measure at 10 and 50 again (appendix new)
- then, a few centimeters more in, at 30 again (appendix new)
