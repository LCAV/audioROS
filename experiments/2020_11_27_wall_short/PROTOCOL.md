# EXPERIMENT NAME

__Time__: Day DD.MM.YYYY

__Recorded by__: First Last, ...

__Place__: Place, if necessary temperature etc. 

## Notes 

New experiments with shorter sweeps, not really useful anymore.
- last ok csv file was recorded at nomotors_nosnr_noprops_sweep_high_20.csv
- last audio timestamp that was received: 1172919471, at timestamp: 9661952. Then we had many unexpected packets.
- stopped responding at distance 29: nomotors_nosnr_noprops_sweep_low_29_0.db3
