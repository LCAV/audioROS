# EXPERIMENT NAME

__Recorded by__: First Last, ...

__Place__: Place, if necessary temperature etc. 

## Notes 

<!-- quick and dirty notes, to be written out later -->

Potentailly very high propellor noise from resonance of table? 
- fixed and centered drone
- yaw_rate_deg logging in addition to yaw_deg

Important:
- different origin than for other experiments! 
- kind of loud noise from stepper motor! 

Did 90 degree experiments in a second round
