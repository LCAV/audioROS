# EXPERIMENTS

This folder contains drone acoustic measurements. 

## Notes 

- Up to 2020_11_23_wall, all bag files are missing! Got deleted when removing from git? If so, can we recover them? 

## Drone DOA experiments

- 2020_09_17 to 1010_11_18: first experiments done downstairs (only 2020_09_17?)
- 2020_10_static_new: experiments in office, drone fixed
- "dynamic" datasets: drone moved manually

## Drone wall detection experiments

- 2020_11_23_wall: super long linear motor, crashed after some time
- 2020_11_23_wall2: still super long linear motor, did full experiments (some of them had to be redone manually)

starting from here there were soundcard issues:
- 2020_11_26_wall: more finegrained experiments with shorter motor. no motors
- 2020_11_27_wall_props: same as above but with motors, however many recordings have no motor sound because of battery issues
- 2020_11_27_wall_short: same as above with shorter sweeps, after implementing battery monitoring. 

soundcard fixed:
- 2020_11_30_wall_hover: frequency study of hovering drone (only one experiment)
- 2020_12_2_chirp: frequency study of buzzer deck

external power source:
- 2020_12_3_wall_props: experiments with and without propellers, with 2 different frequency sweeps, at different distances and different (fixed) angles. this should replace experiments 1-5 of this category.
